                <h4 class="my-3">Ricky Parada returns to Stanford University</h4>

                <p class="my-3"> We were happy to host Ricky Parada, 3rd year Eng. Phys. student at Stanford, 
                    for a two-month research experience working in close collaboration with Simón Paiva (MSc Physics) 
                    Bastián Martinez (CS). Ricky made significant contributions to one of our projects on machine learning
                    for solving inverse problems in optics. He also participated in science outreach activities 
                    at a high-school in Santiago.  
                </p>
                <p class="my-3">
                We wish Ricky all the best in his future projects, and look forward a future visit.  
            </p>
