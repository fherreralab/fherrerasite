                Our group is honored to receive joint support from the Air Force Office of Scientific Resarch (AFOSR) 
                and the Office of Naval Research Global (ONRG) to develop theory leading to applications of 
                Molecular Polaritons in quantum technology. 

                The grant includes support for up to three postdoctoral researchers with experience and strong interest 
                in open quantum system dynamics and quantum electrodynamics. 
            </p>
